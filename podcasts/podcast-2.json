        "episode_transcript": " The it's always the right time deal. Hey want to go to Mickey D's for lunch? Oh let's go now. But it's not lunchtime yet. If we're going to McDonald's it's always the right time. Yeah it's hard to argue with that. There's a deal for every lunch hour at McDonald's. Now's the time we get two for $3.99. Mix and match of four-piece McNuggets, a McDouble, a McChicken or a Hot and Spicy McChicken. Price and participation may vary cannot be combined with any other offer. You can get a single item at regular price. Well the NFL preseason has a couple of games for each team and all the starters have mainly played. There will be some starters playing in the preseason finales. We'll get to all that and more. It's the Audible Cecil Lammy here flying solo. Sigma Bloom on assignment and Jonathan Taylor has requested a trade. I'm not exactly sure why this was such a big news story because it had already been kind of out there that Jonathan Taylor would be granted or allowed to look for a trade or wanted a trade or were staying away from the Indianapolis Colts and listen as someone who fully believes in Anthony Richardson, I believed in Anthony Richardson with Jonathan Taylor doing a lot of the heavy lifting. The Colts were to lose Jonathan Taylor as it seems like that may happen. Well that's bad news for that young quarterback because well defenses can just pin their ears back and get after him because you don't have a back like Taylor on the roster behind him. Taylor is one of the best running backs in all of football. Great receiver out of the backfield as well. He's a superstar at the position when he's healthy and that was a benefit for that Colts team without him. Well that would be a problem. Now as of this recording here on Tuesday August 22nd who would want Jonathan Taylor? Where would he go? Obviously you would have to pay him once you pick him up via trade. What would the Colts want? It's a premium pick but there seems to be one team that's emerging above all others and there's hot rumors with every team and there's one that seems to make the most sense right now and again as of this recording it's the Miami Dolphins. Miami Dolphins were interested in Dalvin Cook. Of course Cook signs with the New York Jets so he can be Aaron Rodgers best friend and lead that backfield there but the Miami Dolphins had interest in Cook as well. Jonathan Taylor would be perfect for what Mike McDaniel and that Dolphins offense wants to do because they got speed everywhere. Now Devon A-Chain is a little bit banged up a little bit of a shoulder injury and of course you've got what Jeff Wilson or he mostered there as well. Jonathan Taylor had come in and run everything like how would you stop the Dolphins offense and of course to a stay and healthy would be a big key a very large key but if you had a Jonathan Taylor to that mix with that team that would be incredible because you'd have power and receiving ability from Taylor you'd have speed on the outside you just have weapons after weapons that you could go to so will the Dolphins be able to get it done will other teams emerge usually there has to be in order for any sort of bidding war for the services of one Jonathan Taylor for a big trade like that to be made and checking in with a few teams that might have had interest I'm getting no buzz about that yet it is the Miami Dolphins that are at the front runners of that situation it may be the Las Vegas Raiders although I'll get to that and Josh Jacobs a little bit later in the show it's preseason there's a lot of stuff on the field there's a lot of preseason movers and last Thursday I thought it was funny that Ron Rivera head coach of the Washington commander said well you know Sam Howe entered for you know training camp as the favorite to be the starter we'll have to wait and see you have to talk to Eric Bienemi I believe their quarterbacks coach is Tavita Pritchard and well then on Monday night we saw Sam Howe go out there and do some really good things as we knew he would 19 to 25 180 yards two touchdowns in that game the commanders there on Monday going up against Baltimore but got some bad news about Terry McLaurin that's coming up in a little bit but these position battles like some of them are just done basically some of them are done and wrapped up and Sam Howe has been an underrated quarterback for some time at North Carolina of course he had that final season that causes draft stock to take a tumble but before entering his final season with the Tar Heels he was considered a first-round pick and maybe even number one overall kind of like Baker Mayfield more on him and his situation a little bit so how I mean just name him the starter like we're at you know what or get off the pot sorry Joe time in the National Football League and this you know preseason competition like yeah we already know how I want it okay just name it name how the starter and move on and move forward now with Terry McLaurin with the toe injury now the toe injury is something we don't know yet if it's turf toe but isn't every toe injury turf toe or doesn't it seem like it morphs into turf toe or can become turf toe quickly and turf toe and incredibly gross injury when it's describes you it's a bit it's been described to me by several NFL players like that turf toe is just gruesome and it's painful and it lingers and now here we are on August 22nd and Terry McLaurin is likely to miss some time or at least not be a hundred percent at the start of the regular season we don't yet know again the injury just happened on Monday night here we are Tuesday looking at this thing going I don't know what's gonna happen with Terry McLaurin but as I told you on the last show Jehan Dotson could be their version of Terry Kael now Jehan Dotson may have to do more if Terry McLaurin is either not himself or not out there on the field so you know changing statuses preseason movers is kind of the topic of this show and there's movers in terms of moving via trade if like a Jonathan Taylor goes to Miami there's movers in terms of Sam Howell rising up the depth chart or at least cementing that starting job as he was the leader heading into training camp and then there's movers based on Terry McLaurin's got a toe injury those things can linger who's next Oh Jehan Dotson who's already been impressive and already can make big-time plays for that commander's offense here's Baker the baby maker I'll talk about him next because they haven't made a decision isn't it clear that Baker may feel is outplayed Kyle Trask in the preseason isn't it clear obviously that he has the experience edge over Kyle Trask and again teams are just kind of in the we got to wait and see mode now you've got to make a decision because 53-man rosters have to be built within the week by the way and then as Joe Lexus that say things move pretty quickly around here in a week we'll have teams trimming their rosters as they prepare for the start of the regular season and in that week we will hear more of who's the starter who's the backup in these situations and I've seen the future the future includes Baker Mayfield as the starter for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers I don't think that's great for any of their skill position players even my man Rashad white like I don't think it's a it would cut in the side Kyle Trask could be great for those guys either but it will be Baker he will be the starter and we're just waiting for them to actually announce that and then move forward with Baker Mayfield as their starter we'll see what all happens to all those skill position guys in this offense that is and it's the NFC South anyway like there's some roughness among all of those teams involved Baker win that starting job with the Buccaneers I am sure of it I'm also sure that we'll see Isaiah Pacheco in the preseason finale something that Andy Reid had said and Isaiah Pacheco of course my favorite although there is another as Yoda would say it is Daenerys Prince and remember what I told you on last week's show there's people within the building in Kansas City that believe Prince is better than Pacheco Pacheco is the starter he's the angriest runner in the league and if he gets banged up again unlike last year when you just played through the injury and what are you gonna do go to Clyde Edwards a layer no Pacheco is gonna play banged up this year you know they might give him some rest and Daenerys Prince could be that guy that you know plays well as expected by the Chiefs and the Chiefs who love him but either way Pacheco looking to play in that preseason finale we'll see what he does probably won't be a whole lot we just saw Gervonta Williams on Saturday get in for the Denver Broncos and he was able to play did a lot more than I expected him to even Sean Payton leading into that game said you're gonna have about four touches from Gervonta get him about 12 snaps well he played more than that and off the top my head he had five targets four catches and then four rushes so we had eight touches total for Gervonta working in tandem with some IGP Ryan and their third guy Jaleel McLaughlin so like Pacheco is coming back from the shoulder thing Gervonta coming back from major major knee injury that's a different thing but we will see Pacheco probably not a ton but Helene Tariq one is their starter working with Jereg McKinnon in that backfield and of course that wide open high-powered offense it's just gonna score 30 plus points seemingly every single week so keep an eye on the Pacheco situation again I don't expect him to do much if he actually does play Andy Reid is saying he will play and we shall see about that Josh Jacobs deleted a tweet oh it's always forever baby it's the internet right and someone tell Josh Jacobs that like you can tweet it you can delete it but somebody's gonna screen grab that thing before you hit delete and well there's been reports now Josh Jacobs will report to the team to the Las Vegas Raiders before week one and pretty much every Raiders beat writer had that so this isn't breaking news or anything and Jacobs then goes to Twitter he tweets a denial to those reports and then he deletes that what's gonna happen in this situation would the Raiders who don't want to pay Jacobs want to play Jonathan Taylor probably not but do you want to go forward without Josh Jacobs no he's your best back if possible I mean I appreciate Zemir White in dynasty formats but like Josh Jacobs is clearly better obviously so we'll look at the situation with John Jacobs and see what this team can do to make him happy if they at all can which the answer is no but you know these hold-ins what's the last one we saw like a Melvin Gordon situation where Gordon's like I'm gonna stay away and you just go ahead and pay the other guy and they're like okay and that led to problems for Melvin Gordon what are the problems with Josh Jacobs so he plays for the Raiders that's a start secondly it's running back it's an exploitative position teams don't want to pay guys and then you can't really go anywhere in you know you can ask for a trade like Jonathan Taylor you can be granted the permission to seek a trade but if someone isn't giving you what a team thinks is fair they're just gonna sit on your rights basically and say it's your move you can either play for us or you can not play at all and that's what's staring at Jonathan Taylor right now that's obviously what's going on with Josh Jacobs there as well so we shall see about that but player movement preseason movement with Josh Jacobs things are just kind of stagnant things are just kind of there and have I don't know necessarily calm down but the natural progression of things and this is why some reports just don't shock me I think it's probably just come old and I've been around this game a long time but I'm holding in I really don't want to play for you guys and then you know two weeks before the start of the season I'm back and we've you know I'm still unhappy but I'm here like this is just what was going to happen with Josh Jacobs again he tweeted a denial to the reports that he's gonna report if that makes sense and then he deleted that tweet so Josh Jacobs if he's in Raiders camp I wouldn't be surprised and there's some of these moves like if the Miami Dolphins trade for Jonathan Taylor if they get something of compensation to the Colts that they want I wouldn't be surprised I wouldn't be surprised if Josh Jacobs just shows up and not necessarily kiss and makeup but they just you know it's business baby and they're just taking care of business and trying to make it happen somehow some way now Cornell Patterson with the hot lamp of Falcons we got to talk about this situation because Patterson is expected to miss some time he's got an undisclosed injury a couple weeks it's a soft tissue injury that's according to Arthur mr. Arthur Smith and Patterson that means if he's gonna miss a couple of weeks he's out for the rest of the preseason we don't yet know about his week one availability we know that Tyler Algier and of course Bijon Robinson who is a superstar any super stud and keeps moving up draft boards like yeah fine I'm fine with you taking Bijon Robinson as high as you possibly can in my opinion with that amazing talent and the way this team in that division again remember we're talking about the NFC South like they could make some more noise than people think comes down to Ritter and his response to pressure but with CPAT we know what he does as that receiving weapon now that might just go more Bijon more Tyler in terms of receiving downs if Cordell Patterson with the soft tissue injury has to miss more time we'll continue to watch that situation as it unfolds for the Atlanta Falcons and know that you know preseason roles are changing news is changing of course players are rising players are falling like I said Sam Howe Zay Flowers in that game if I talk about the Monday night game again commanders and Ravens Zay Flowers doing more because Rashad Bateman who was activated off pup is still banged up shocker so look to the Zay Flowers continuing to move up the the list and again as teams get to the point of the preseason where you just got to just tell us what you're gonna do that we already know you're gonna do we know Sam Howe is gonna start with the commanders we know that Baker Mayfield is gonna start with the Buccaneers we know that CJ Stroud is going to be the starter like he's been a top the depth chart this entire preseason he's gonna have rookie struggles but Stroud will benefit just like Bryce Young just like Anthony Richardson of just plain experience is your best teacher you have information knowledge and wisdom will replace information with experience which gives you knowledge which again gives you wisdom when you put your knowledge into action that is true wisdom that's what we need to see from a guy like CJ Stroud so teams are kind of you know getting things ready getting I can't tell you to lose weight but I can tell you to get tighter get tighter with that roster and as we get closer to the regular season you're seeing guys that are getting worked back into the mix for example Miles Sanders with the Carolina Panthers he returned to practice on Monday he has missed most of training camp at the preseason because of this groin injury you also had Chuba Hubbard with a little bit of an ankle thing but now we're at the point of you just kind of got to stop messing around guys are gonna be ready for the regular season get them ready for the regular season that includes a Miles Sanders there as well other newsy type stuff from the National Football League Cooper Cup is expected to practice this week now what's fun and interesting is I will be seeing Cooper Cup this week I will see Cooper Cup in joint practices with the Denver Broncos right here in Denver so that starts on Wednesday as training camp is over and I'll have to be careful what I report based on Sean Payton's media policy but Cooper Cup will be out there for the Rams excuse me how much does he do in joint practices with the Broncos don't yet know we know Aaron Donald expecting the birth of I believe it's his third child will not be participating in joint practices with the Broncos which is bad for Denver because they need to react to Russell Wilson being under pressure because Russell Wilson is gonna be under pressure all season long but Cooper Cup on the other side doesn't need a whole lot this preseason game Rams and Broncos just for example as we get into the final preseason game for teams this is the third game but it's like the fourth game used to be and in that closet not only with comic books that I sell but also with those videotapes of preseason games I have that many week four preseason games on tape from back of the day because week four doesn't matter weeks one through three matter now every team is different certainly the Rams don't like playing their starters in the preseason but this preseason finale let's say for example for the Denver Broncos I don't need to see Givante I don't need to see some Ajay honestly I don't need to see Jaleel McLaughlin either that's your electric and explosive back and no he's not the starter please everybody don't be ridiculous I've seen people suggest that like he should be the starter like no you don't need that so Cooper Cup the joint practices because I wouldn't imagine that he'll play in that game even if he wasn't banged up it's Sean McVeigh doesn't want to play his starters in preseason I'm gonna be watching Cup very closely just to know and to learn like where is he at how much does he have left to do how ready for the start of the regular season pros pros like Cooper Cup it doesn't need a lot of time to shake off the rust so looking forward to seeing him out there on the football field as well with the Rams I happen to be talking to one Matt Waldman who was fantastic called me the other day and he's like hey check out Zach Evans for me like see what to see what that kid's doing there with the Rams so okay yeah I'm gonna be checking out Zach Evans certainly having the Rams in town of these joint practices to me are much better and much more beneficial than a preseason game because coaches get to control what they want to see they control the script the opponents don't know but the coaches will collaborate it's a collab and they'll get together and say hey I want to work on this we need to work on red zone we would work on this let's try some deep stuff and so you'll go out there and through these scripts you'll run through not the Aaron Foster scripts but through these scripts you will run through practice where you get to see exactly what you want to see and what your team needs to work on so there's Rams players that I will be watching for example deep dynasty Stetson Bennett is anything there he's better than Brett Rippon that's not saying much so you know these joint practices are very very important anytime someone does it with the Broncos where I can see it or other teams that do it and I'm gonna I'm gonna go do it and you want to watch those practice reports because you can learn so much from those there as well so it is you know kind of the end of the preseason really again the preseason finale most teams already have their 53s I could I could put together the 53 for the Denver Broncos right now that'd be no problem I know other teams are exactly like that as well so when we look at this time of year the teams are basically set your preseason risers they've already risen your precincts and fallers have already fallen now it's time to basically get everybody healthy and get ready for the start of the regular season also get ready for the fantasy drafts out there that are very thorough this time
